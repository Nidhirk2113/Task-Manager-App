# Task Manager (LocalStorage) — Static Frontend

A small interactive Task Manager built with plain HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript.
Persists tasks to `localStorage` and visualizes progress with Chart.js.

## Features
- Add / Edit / Delete tasks
- Toggle complete / incomplete
- Priority: high / medium / low
- Filter: All / Pending / Completed
- Sort: Newest / Oldest / A→Z / Priority
- Progress bar + Doughnut chart (Chart.js)
- Local-only persistence (no backend)
- Responsive and accessible UI

## Run locally
1. Clone or copy project files into a folder, e.g. `task-manager-local/`.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (no server required).

## Deploy to Vercel (static)
1. Create a GitHub repo and push the project (ensure `index.html` is at repo root).
2. Sign in to https://vercel.com and click **New Project** → Import Git Repository.
3. Choose repository, set framework to **Other**, root is empty, then **Deploy**.
4. Vercel will provide a live URL (e.g. `https://your-repo.vercel.app`).

> Notes: localStorage is browser-specific. Data will not sync across devices/browsers.

## Customization
- To change storage key, update `KEY` in `js/storage.js`.
- To convert to PWA, add `manifest.json` and service worker.
- For server-backed sync, replace StorageAPI with REST calls.
